## Homework 15 feedback

On lines 16 and 17, you can omit them, because both ggplot and dplyr are included in tidyverse.

Your data folder did not include the compensation dataset, so I was unable to run your code (though it looked ok). Be sure in future that any code that you run has the data required for it within the r project data folder.
